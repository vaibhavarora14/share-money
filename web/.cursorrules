# ShareMoney Landing Page

## Important Context

**This `web/` folder is a LANDING PAGE ONLY** - it is NOT the full ShareMoney web application.

### What this is:
- A marketing/onboarding landing page
- Built with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Serves as the entry point for users to learn about ShareMoney
- Provides download links for iOS/Android apps
- Links to the web beta application (hosted elsewhere)

### What this is NOT:
- The full ShareMoney web application
- The production web app
- The main application codebase

### Key Files:
- `src/App.tsx` - Main landing page component
- `src/components/` - Landing page components (FAQ, TrustBadges, etc.)
- `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` - Dark mode for landing page
- `src/hooks/useScrollAnimation.ts` - Scroll animations for landing page

### When making changes:
- Remember this is a marketing site, not the app itself
- Focus on conversion (getting users to download apps or try web beta)
- Keep it simple and focused on onboarding
- The actual ShareMoney application code is in the `mobile/` folder or hosted separately
